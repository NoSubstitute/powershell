## I will put the script's content here tomorrow.
## This script doesn't work anymore, as it used the now deprecated Azure AD APIs, replaced by MS Graph APIs.
## I need help converting the AAD parts.

## The Exchange API parts are working fine.
## So it deleted with ease about 1500 Contacts from Exchange, as the AAD part wasn't able to List Users to the array.
## Since the array was empty, the script was supposed to delete those contacts, which it did. :-)
